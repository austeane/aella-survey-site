BKSPublic.parquet - Column Modification Notes
==============================================
15,511 rows x 376 columns

This is a ~1.6% stratified subsample of the full BKS dataset (~980K responses).
Reference the GT source file for original question wording.

These notes describe columns that were binned, combined, renamed, or computed
in ways that differ from the original GT survey questions. If you're looking
for a GT question and can't find it, check below — it may have been merged,
renamed, or dropped.


BINNED / COLLAPSED COLUMNS
---------------------------

straightness
  Original: Computed from attractedtomasculine + attractedtofeminine (continuous).
  Now: 5 levels (Gay, Leaning gay, Bi, Leaning straight, Straight)
  Source columns (attractedtomasculine, attractedtofeminine, penis/vagina
  attraction) have been removed.

sexcount ("How many people have you had sex with?")
  Original: Free-text numeric entry (0-600)
  Now: 5 bins (0, 1-2, 3-7, 8-20, 21+)

  Now: 3 levels (Repressed, Neutral, Liberated)
  Highly/Moderately/Slightly repressed -> Repressed
  Equally repressed/liberated -> Neutral
  Slightly/Moderately/Highly liberated -> Liberated


COMBINED / MERGED COLUMNS
--------------------------

childhood_adversity
  Combined from two separate GT questions:
    - "Were you (at least semiregularly) abused as a child?" (abuse)
    - "As a child, were you the victim of sexual assault?" (sexualAssaultLevel)
  Now: 2 levels (None, Any)
  "Any" = answered Yes to either or both. Original columns removed.

childhood_gender_tolerance
  Combined from two separate GT questions:
    - "In your childhood culture, how did people feel about traditional
       gender role violations?" (tkpfq6j)
    - "In your childhood culture, how did people feel about visible
       genderbending?" (gjt7igv)
  Both were 6-level scales from "So normal nobody noticed" to "Nearly
  unheard of, if done generated full community eviction."
  Averaged the two (mapped to 0-5 numeric), then binned:
    Low avg (intolerant cultures) -> "Intolerant"
    Mid avg -> "Medium"
    High avg (tolerant cultures) -> "Tolerant"
  Original columns removed.

  Now: 2 levels (None, Any)
  0 -> None; 1+ -> Any

  consciensiousnessvariable OCEAN personality (avg of sub-questions, range -6 to 6)
  extroversionvariable      OCEAN personality (avg of sub-questions, range -6 to 6)
  neuroticismvariable       OCEAN personality (avg of sub-questions, range -6 to 6)

  totalfetishcategory       Count of fetish categories with any interest
  bondageaverage            Average across bondage sub-items
  Total* columns            Sum/count columns for various fetish categories
